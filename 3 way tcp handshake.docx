How 3-way TCP handshake works

The three-way TCP handshake is a process that establishes a reliable connection between two devices over a TCP/IP network.
  
TCP Handshakke process:

SYN (Synchronize): The client sends a TCP packet with the SYN flag set to the server. This packet contains an initial sequence number (ISN) to start the conversation.

SYN-ACK (Synchronize-Acknowledge): The server responds with a TCP packet. It sets the SYN and ACK flags, acknowledging the client's request. It also generates its own ISN for this connection.

ACK (Acknowledge): Finally, the client acknowledges the server's response by sending another TCP packet with the ACK flag set. The sequence number in this packet is incremented by 1, 

confirming that both sides have synchronized their sequence numbers.

At this point, the three-way handshake is complete, and a reliable TCP connection has been established. Both devices are ready to exchange data with each other, 
  
knowing that the connection is valid and error-checked. This process helps ensure data integrity and proper communication between devices in a TCP/IP network.
