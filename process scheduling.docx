Process Scheduling in operating systems
  
The process scheduling is the activity of the process manager of the operating system that handles the removal of the running process from the CPU and the selection of another process on the basis of a particular strategy.
Process scheduling along with time multipexing is what makes multiprogramming posssible in operating systems. 

Categories of Scheduling:
  
a. Non-preemptive: 
Here the computer's resources canâ€™t be taken from a process until the process completes execution. The switching of resources occurs when the running process terminates and moves to a waiting state.
  
b.Preemptive:
Here the OS allocates the resources to a process for a fixed amount of time. During resource allocation, the process switches from running state to ready state or from waiting state to ready state. This switching occurs as the CPU may give priority to other processes and replace the process with higher priority with the running process.

process scheduling algorithms
  
a.First Come Frist Serve:
FCFS considered to be the simplest of all operating system scheduling algorithms. First come first serve scheduling algorithm states that the process that requests the CPU first is allocated the CPU first and is implemented by using FIFO (First In Frist Out) queue.

b.Shortest job first (SJF) 
SJF is a scheduling process  algortihm that selects the waiting process with the smallest execution time to execute next. This scheduling method may or may not be preemptive. Significantly reduces the average waiting time for other processes waiting to be executed.

c.Longest Job First(LJF):
Longest Job First(LJF) scheduling process is just opposite of shortest job first (SJF), as the name suggests this algorithm is based upon the fact that the process with the largest burst time is processed first. Longest Job First is non-preemptive in nature.

d.Priority Scheduling:
Preemptive Priority CPU Scheduling Algorithm is a pre-emptive method of CPU scheduling algorithm that works based on the priority of a process. In this algorithm, the editor sets the functions to be as important, meaning that the most important process must be done first. In the case of any conflict, that is, where there are more than one processor with equal value, then the most important CPU planning algorithm works on the basis of the FCFS (First Come First Serve) algorithm.

d.Round robin:
Round Robin is a CPU scheduling algorithm where each process is cyclically assigned a fixed time slot. It is the preemptive version of First come First Serve CPU Scheduling algorithm. Round Robin CPU Algorithm generally focuses on Time Sharing technique.
